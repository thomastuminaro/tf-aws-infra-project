1/ Create network interface and attachment so that EC2 has two interface, one public and one private, so possible to test access to WEB 
=> only for testing, when all works, only one interface private should be used 
2/ Redesign solution and variables 
=> Should be possible on 2 or 3 AZs 
=> Should be a mapping like : subnet - instance - AZ for each existing instance ex if 4 web servers 

web1 - subnet1 - az1 
web2 - subnet2 - az2 
web3 - subnet3 - az3 
web4 - subnet1 - az1 
etc 
=> should be dynamic 

3/ Reconfigure subnets, EC2 etc depending on design above 
4/ Add listenner configuration to the LB
